# Ensemble_Stock_Trading_with-DRL_optimized
Deep Reinforcement Learning Ensemble for Automated Stock Trading This project implements an ensemble trading strategy using five DRL agents — PPO, DDPG, TD3, SAC, and A2C — to trade the Dow 30 constituents. The system trains each agent on in-sample data, selects the one with the highest Sharpe ratio, and deploys it on out-of-sample data.
